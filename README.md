# Stock Automator

The goal is to develop a program that returns an automatic weekly restock order for a clothing store. 

It calculates which items need to be restocked based on current inventory levels and weekly sales, helping the store maintain optimal stock without manual tracking.

It should provide two alerts. Notifies when the weekly restock order is created, and also warns if any item falls below its minimum stock during the week.
