# Stock Automator Project

The goal is to develop a program that returns an automatic weekly restock order for a clothing store. 

It calculates which items need to be restocked based on current inventory levels and weekly sales, helping the store maintain optimal stock without manual tracking.

It should provide two alerts. Notifies when the weekly restock order is created, and also warns if any item reaches close its minimum stock during the week.

## Workflow 

### 1. Input: generate the current stock and sales data
* In `main.py` script, the user should define the number of lines of stock items and sales items that occured last week.

* Then `generate_stock.py` file is called and returns a resumed stock list, calculates the total quantity for each item, displays a minimum amount that should always be stored, all based on a random stock list generated by the user, and saves the output in the `stock.csv` file. 

* The same happens to `generate_sales.py` file. It returns a table containing all resumed sales of the last week, ensures none of the items have a sell amount larger than its initial stock, and saves the data in `sales.csv`.

### 2. Output: return a restock order table
* In `main.py`, a show_restock function is called with the stock and sales table as its arguments (the user input).

* The function has two functions inside: `new_stock`, that returns a restock amount for each item following the formula: new_amount = 2 * minimum_stock - available_amount_after_sales.

* Also, the `warn_min` function checks which items are approaching their minimum stock and returns a warning list to alert the store manager.

* The program prints the restock order and warnings in the terminal, and also writes the restock order to `restock.csv`.
